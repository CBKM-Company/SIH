        <h1>Snippets/Abstract</h1>
        <p>Let me clear you one thing that no system can provide 100% security We
          are trying to provide best possible.</p>

        <ol> 
          <li>Handling Patient’s report is
            very difficult to manage like Long history from various different
            hospitals , medical reports .And even prescriptions</li>
          <li>It is even more
            difficult to share between many medical practitioners</li>
          <li>So we came up
            with an idea to provide all access to these facility at one point
            access . ie app</li>
          <li>So we decided to Digitize the Health Record to EHR</li>
          <li>Which bring ease of manageability and shareability </li>
          <li>We believe in
            making a trusted system where members are not trusting each other.</li>
          <li>So BlockChain is the Solution.</li>
        </ol>


        <h1>Why BlockChain ?</h1>
        <p>BlockChain gives power of ​ Immutability​ , Transparency​ , Accountability​ ,Security​ of transaction and
          assets.
          We are using private blockchain network
          As we cannot risk keeping the record in public blockchain because anyone
          can see the transaction . Although the data is Immutable but there will be
          privacy issue
          As BlockChain is ​ Immutable , ​ so no one can temper it and also the data is
          cryptographically hashed , linked to each other and stored so it’s difficult
          to decrypt it .
        </p>

        <h1>Why not the Cloud System ?</h1>
        <p>Patient is very sensitive to his data and is not willing to share with anyone .
          We need a Trusted authority like the government or local public hospitals .
          Centralized third party will be worse in this case
          Distributed Ledger Technology is the Solution .
          Combination of DLT and Blockchain is FIRE
          Even Distributed system is possible with clouds
          So we are using it by EC2 instance and various d
          ocker​ container for
          virtualization ​ only​ f ​ or Development</p>


        <h1>How do things work ?</h1>
        <p>We are using Hyper-Ledger fabric build by Linux foundation
          It helps in making public blockchain and various peers for RPC (Remote
          procedure Calls)
          As you can see in the first fig (Hyperledger Infrastructure )
          We have 4 docker containers</p>

        <ol>
          <li>CA Server this provide public and private keys for every user and
            manage its expiration and all other things .MSP (Membership Service
            Provider )</li>
          <li>Order : as the name suggest that it keeps the track of sequence of
            transaction and we build it on KAFKA (it helps in making real time
            streaming pipelines which is s ​ calable​ )</li>
          <li>Peer : we are using at least 4 peers for development but it is more
            scalable every peer is connected to its own DataBase</li>
          <li>Couch DB :- this is what the hyperledger uses to store unstructured
            data . And deep down It uses LevelDB</li>
          <li>Client Peer is to provide RPC to client request</li>
          <li>Endorser peer​ checks the Certificate details and others to validate
            the transaction.</li>
          <li>Anchor peer​ receives updates and broadcasts the updates to the
            other ​ peers​ in the organization. As Anchor peer is discoverable so
            we can communicate to other organization by GOSSIP protocol</li>
          <li>There are two more folder C
            onfig ​ folder stores all the channel and
            peer configuration and ​ Crypto f ​ older stores all the crypto material
            like digital certificates</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Tech-Stack</h1>
        <h4>We are having vast techstack so we have divided it into 4 main sections</h4>

        <ol>
          <li>We are using GoLang as hyperledger fabric is build using it to make
            consensus algorithm</li>
          <li>Yamal (yml ) file are used to config channel ,transaction and genesis
            blocks</li>
          <li>CouchDB & LevelDBare databases and levelDB works on low level
            format</li>
          <li>Rest Server it governs all the processes</li>
          <li>We are building it using Nodejs ,with express for REST API calls and
            Passport for authentication with aadhar (if possible ) or Phone no. or
            Google</li>
          <li>MongoDB as Database to store various assets</li>
          <li>ML Services​ we are also providing report analysis, chatbot
            ,recommendation system etc . where we are in need for all this
            libraries</li>
          <li>Coming to the front end part we are providing end points website and
            app</li>
          <li>We are Using react for faster building and native application
            HTML CSS JS are basics and cordova/phonegap for android
            development</li>
          <li>Hosting is done on ​ EC2​ Instance and we are using ​ Docker ​ for
            virtualization (only for development )</li>
          <li>OS preferred is Linux Ubuntu</li>

        </ol>



        <h1>How are we maintaining security ?</h1>
        <p>We are storing millions of unstructured data mostly like text image pdfs
          ...etc
          Hence ,
          We are ​ Using ​ asymmetric public-private keys​ provided by PKI (public key
          infrastructure ) from MSP (Membership service provider ) to encrypt-decrypt
          stored data. With RSA algorithm
          Just like SSL we are storing the data and enhancing the security
          And using blockchain we double up the security as data is stored in encrypted
          form and linked to each other through hash. Brings immutability</p>



        <h1>How are we sharing the EHR?</h1>
        <p>We are providing ​ Controlled Authority t ​ o patient
          As there is public blockchain
          So need of mining and all that time consuming tasks is removed
          Hyperledger fabric provides secure transaction where two peer can
          communicate with each other without the knowledge of the other peers
          So patent can initiate transaction through physical process like OTP or QR
          SCAN
          And we verify it by private-public key pair just like SSL
          We are also providing room for researchers where patient can send
          anonymous data for research in labs and universities
          As you can see in the fig
          Among the radiologists pharmacist and other medical practitioners we are
          also using physical authentication to share EHR or part of EHR</p>



        <h1>Why Only We (WOW) ?</h1>
        <p>We are providing a plugin for the peer like hospitals and labs and clinics
          where every one can easily join our network with authentication (of course )
          . In there existing infrastructure</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HIPAA integration
            ● HIPAA​ : Acronym that stands for the Health Insurance
            Portability and Accountability Act, a US law designed to provide
            privacy standards to protect patients' medical records and other
            health information provided to health plans, doctors, hospitals
            and other health care providers</li>
          <li>User friendly Product.</li>
