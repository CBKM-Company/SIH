       <h3> Consensus Based Knowledge Making </h3>
    </center>
    <h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
    <p>Before Presenting our Idea or Solution<br>
      Let me make this thing clear that no system can provide 100% security</p>
    <p>But we have take this initiative to provide it as best as possible</p>
    <p>Firstly we all know that :-</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Handling Patient’s report is very difficult to manage for example<br>
          Maintaining long history from different hospitals , medical reports .and even prescriptions</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is even more difficult to share this information between different medical practitioners.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>So we came up with an idea to provide access to all these facilities at one point . our application</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Via which we have decided to Digitize the Health Record to Electronic Health Record.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Which brings ease to manageability and shareability .</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>We believe in making a system for generating trust, when individuals do not already trust each
            other.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>So best solution suits to the problem statement is <strong>BlockChain</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1 id="why-blockchain-">Why BlockChain ?</h1>
    <p>BlockChain gives power of <strong>Immutability, Transparency, Accountability, Security</strong> of transaction
      and assets.</p>
    <p>In our project<br>
      We are using private blockchain network<br>
      As we cannot risk keeping the record in public blockchain because anyone can see the transaction . Although the
      data is Immutable but there will be privacy issues.</p>
    <p>As BlockChain is <strong>Immutable</strong> therefore explicit tempering cannot be done also the data is
      cryptographically hashed , linked to each other and stored hence , it’s difficult to decrypt it .</p>
    <h1 id="why-not-the-cloud-system-">Why not the Cloud System ?</h1>
    <p>Cloud could have been a better option for the case but since</p>
    <p>Patient is very sensitive towards his information and avoids sharing its information to anyone .</p>
    <p>Users generally wish to have <strong>Trusted Authorities</strong> like the government secured services etc ….</p>
    <p>Centralized third party has always been worse in such cases for which</p>
    <p>Distributed Ledger Technology can be used as a Solution .</p>
    <p>But since we are trying to provide the best security service therefore we are combining DLT with BC.</p>
    <p>Distributed systems are also used in such cases which is why we are using EC2 instance and various **Docker
      Containers for virtualization only for Development **.</p>
    <h1 id="how-do-things-work-">How do things work ?</h1>
    <p>We are using <strong>Hyper-Ledger Fabric</strong> built by Linux foundation .</p>
    <p>As you can see in the first fig (Hyperledger Infrastructure )<br>
      We have 4 docker containers</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>CA Server:</strong> This container provides public and private keys for each user and has a track on
          the expiration period of these keys .MSP (Membership Service Provider ).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Orderer :</strong> this keeps a track of sequence of transaction which is build on KAFKA (it helps in
          making real time streaming pipelines that are scalable )</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Peer :</strong> It is a node of a hyperledger network that has its own DataBase. We are using at
          least 4 peers for development but it can scale as per the requirement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>** Couch DB :** it is the Database used by the hyperledger to store unstructured data . And deep down It uses
          <strong>LevelDB</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Client Peer</strong> is to provide RPC to client request</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Endorser peer :</strong> It checks the Certificates and details to validate the transaction.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Anchor peer:</strong> it is used to receive updates and broadcasts these updates to the other peers
          in the organization. As Anchor peer is discoverable so we can communicate to other organizations by
          <strong>GOSSIP protocol</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are two more folder <strong>Config</strong> folder stores all the channel and peer configuration and
          <strong>Crypto</strong> folder stores all the crypto material like digital certificates .</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1 id="tech-stack">Tech-Stack</h1>
    <p><em>We are have used vast tech-stack and we have divided it into 4 main sections</em></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>We are using GoLang , as hyperledger fabric is built using it ; for building consensus algorithms.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Yamal (yml ) files in config are used to configure channels ,transaction and genesis block.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>CouchDB &amp; LevelDBare databases and levelDB works on a low level format.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Rest Server is used to govern all the processes.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We are building it using Nodejs ,with ExpressJS for REST API calls and PassportJS for authentication with
          aadhar (if possible ) or Phone no. or Google authentication.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>MongoDB as Database to store various assets .</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We are also providing report analysis, chatbot and recommendation systems through <strong>ML
            Services</strong>. For which we are using these displayed libraries</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Coming to the Front-End part we are providing two endpoints :- website and app.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We are Using <strong>React</strong> for faster building and native application<br>
          HTML CSS JS are basics and cordova/phonegap for android development</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Hosting is done on ** EC2** Instance and <strong>Docker</strong> for virtualization is being used (only for
          development ).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>My Preferred OS is Linux Ubuntu .</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><code>As we mentioned that we will be providing the best security services but the question arises</code></p>
    <h1 id="how-are-we-going-to-deliver-the-best-security-">How are we going to deliver the best security ?</h1>
    <p>We are storing millions of unstructured data mostly like text image pdfs …etc<br>
      Hence ,<br>
      We are Using <strong>asymmetric public-private key pairs</strong> provided by PKI (public key infrastructure )
      from MSP (Membership service provider ) to encrypt-decrypt stored data. With <strong>RSA</strong> algorithm.</p>
    <p>Just like <strong>SSL</strong>, we too are storing the data and enhancing the security by public-private key
      pairs.<br>
      And with the support of blockchain we double the level-up of the security as data is stored in encrypted form and
      linked to each other through hash which brings immutability.</p>
    <h1 id="how-are-we-sharing-the-ehr">How are we sharing the EHR?</h1>
    <p>We are providing Controlled Authority to patient</p>
    <p>Hyperledger fabric provides secure transaction where two peer can communicate with each other without the
      knowledge of the other peers</p>
    <p>So patient can initiate transaction through physical process like OTP or QR SCAN</p>
    <p>And we verify it by private-public key pair just like SSL</p>
    <p>We are also providing room for researchers where patients can send anonymous data for research purposes in labs
      and universities .</p>
    <p>As you can see in the fig</p>
    <p>Among the radiologists pharmacist and other medical practitioners we are also using physical authentication to
      share EHR or part of EHR.</p>
    <h1 id="why-only-we-wow-">Why Only We (WOW) ?</h1>
    <p>We are providing a plugin for the peer like hospitals , labs and clinics where everyone can easily be a part of
      our network with authentication (of course ) . In the existing infrastructure of the organization.</p>
    <p>We are also Integrating HIPAA which is an acronym that stands for the <strong>Health Insurance Portability and
        Accountability Act</strong>, a law designed to provide privacy standards to protect patients’ medical records
      and other health related information provided to health plans, doctors, hospitals and other health care providers
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Apart from all this basic functionality we also provide facilities like</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Caretaker &amp; Nurse services.</p>
      </li>
